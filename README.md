# Welcome!

## Check this page periodically because I tend to post things relatively often.

## This repository will be organized into 4 main sections for now:

## Challenges

    - This will include practice problems for common topics as we cover them in class.
    - The solutions will typically not be posted unless specifically asked in an SI session.

## Data Structures

    - This will be the most important folder.
    - As we cover each data structure (linked lists, arraylists, binary search trees, etc), I will post template code of what the basic functions of each data structure should look like. I will usually only post some functions and leave you to fill in the rest as practice. For example I may include the function for adding an element to the front of a linked list, but I will not write the function for adding an element to the end of a linked list so that you can get some practice in as well.

## Exam Reviews

    - This will just include the files for the exam reviews I create for each exam.
    - Disclaimer: I never see the exams before hand, so I only make the reviews based on my experience having taken this class already.

## Pointers

    - This has a small crash course on pointers for you to follow along step by step to understand pointers.
    - Then there are some challenges for you to put your pointer knowledge to the test.

## Advanced Concepts

    - This will be for tackling the tougher to grasp concepts of C that need to me mastered in order to be proficient.

## Searches

    - This will include the code for linear, binary, and ternary searches.
